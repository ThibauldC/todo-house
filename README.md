# TODO to Telegram
**DISCLAIMER**: this is a personal project where the setup is probably overkill,
but I also use it to play around with some cool Python/GitHub stuff.

That being said, this is a small repo which takes a JSON with tasks and sends a list of daily house chores
to do that day to a specific Telegram chat as a reminder.
